                Motor insurance is just like any other insurance policy, but unlike other insurances, 
                it is â€˜Mandatory'! And, as the name suggests, 
                it is an insurance that is related to all types of motor vehicles-motorcycles, cars, jeeps, 
                commercial vehicles etc.

                Motor insurance has been made mandatory by the government for your safety and the safety of others. 
                And the yearly premium you pay is just a meagre sum when compared to the advantages it has to offer you in case of,
                god forbid, any mishap.
